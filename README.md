# Frogger!

## 1. What is it?

Frogger is a simple game created as part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.

The main objective is to collect as many gems as you can while avoiding collisions with the enemies which are in the shape of nasty bugs.

Every gem collected will give you 100 points. Collisions with bugs or falling into the water won't take points away from you but you will make you lose one life.

You have 5 lives. Once you used them all you will get your final score and you will have the chance to play again to improve your record.

## 2. How to play?

Thanks to GitHub Pages, all you have to do is to follow [this link](http://alan247.github.io/UD-FEND-PJ3-Arcade-Game/) and the game will load on your browser.

In order to play, you only need to use your arrow keys. The whole thing is very intuitive, yo won't have any troubles with it, I'm sure.

Of course, you can also download all the files and play locally on your own computer (in which case, you just need to open the index.html file), although I don't know why you would want to do that, unless, of course, you want to modify the code and add new features, something that I really encourage you to do. The code is thoroughly commented and it shouldn't be hard to discover what's going on under the hood. However, if you want to use this code, please fork the repository instead and if you develop some cool features, don't doubt to send pull requests.

**Thanks for playing!**
